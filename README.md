## Testimonials
**Ananya Rao**:
I'm a 21-year-old engineering student from Bangalore and was feeling very lost and stressed with my coursework. After a friend recommended this Vedanta course to me, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did - the weekly lessons have completely changed my perspective. I've learned invaluable tools for managing my thoughts and finding inner peace, even during busy exam periods. Swami-ji and Pravrajika-ji have made complex philosophical concepts very easy to understand and apply. Most importantly, this course has reconnected me to my true self and purpose beyond academic performance. It has truly been a life-changing experience. I want to thank the teachers for shaping not just my mind, but my character.

**Rohit Kumar**:
As a 20-year-old pursuing my undergrad in Delhi, I was always interested in spirituality but struggled to make sense of ancient texts. This structured online course broke down complex ideas into bit-sized nuggets and linked theory to practical techniques like meditation and journaling. I especially loved connecting with other learners on discussion forums to exchange insights. Six months on, I notice significant changes in my mental conditioning and relationships. Most of all, I feel equipped to face life's uncertainties with equanimity. This has been the most rewarding course I've ever taken.

**Karthik Reddy**:
I'm 23 and working as a software engineer in Hyderabad. Juggling a demanding job and personal life left me exhausted and unfulfilled. This course provided the perfect anchor. The weekly lessons and assignments became my little ode to self-care. I loved how the erudite speakers related ancient wisdom to modern science in a simple, example-rich style. Regular sadhanas have helped me become aware of draining habits and replace them with energizing ones. I'm a calmer, more focused person now. Thank you Swami-ji and Divya Di for helping me discover my true bliss beyond material pleasures. This has deeply enriched my life.

**Aditi Gupta**:
I'm a 34-year old working professional in Mumbai. Juggling long work hours with family responsibilities left me perpetually stressed. I came across this Vedanta course while browsing online classes during my lunch break. To my surprise, the interesting lessons and thought-provoking assignments inspired me to carve out time from my packed schedule. I especially loved relating concepts to real-life examples through reflective journaling. Meditation before starting my day makes a huge difference to my focus and relationships with colleagues. This course brought balance that had been missing from my life for so long. I feel re-energized and better able to handle pressure. Thank you teachers for helping a busy working woman like me establish much-needed self-care practices.

**Sujata Bose**:
I'm a 33-year-old homemaker from Kolkata. Although married with two kids, I often felt purposeless and drained. This course has completely turned things around for me. The calming voice of Swamiji and soulful discourses of Divya Maashi immersed me in self-development. With my family, I now enjoy discussing philosophical insights beyond daily tribulations. Practices like pranayama and reflective journaling help me manage household stress and engage fully as a wife and mother. My husband too has benefitted from a calmer home environment. I feel truly enriched sharing what I'm learning with friends. This course has demonstrated that fulfilling one's Dharma as a homemaker need not come at the cost of one's inner journey. I will always remain grateful to my teachers for empowering me spiritually.

### Ending Notes
